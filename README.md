\`\`\`
User Query ‚Üí Planner ‚Üí Search Execution ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Writing ‚Üí Verification ‚Üí Revision (if needed)
\`\`\`

## ü§ñ Agent Architecture

The system employs 7 specialized AI agents working in coordination:

### 1. **Planner Agent** (`o3-mini`)
- Analyzes legal research queries and creates strategic search plans
- Generates 4-6 targeted searches focusing on authoritative legal sources
- Prioritizes federal and New York State law, recent court decisions, and agency guidance

### 2. **Search Agent** (`o4-mini` + web search)
- Executes planned searches using web search tools
- Summarizes findings from authoritative legal sources (max 300 words)
- Prioritizes federal agencies (HUD, USDA/FNS, CMS, SSA) and NY agencies (OTDA)

### 3. **Legal Analyst Agent** (`gpt-4.1` + web search)
- Provides specialized legal analysis of statutes, regulations, and case law
- **Can perform independent web searches** for current legal authorities
- Extracts key legal citations using **Bluebook (21st Edition)** format
- Identifies procedural requirements and eligibility criteria

### 4. **Policy Impact Agent** (`gpt-4.1` + web search)
- Analyzes practical impact on low-income clients and vulnerable populations
- **Can search for current policy implementation data** and real-world impacts
- Identifies implementation challenges and advocacy opportunities
- Considers effects on immigrants, people with disabilities, families, and elderly

### 5. **Writer Agent** (`o4-mini`, medium reasoning effort)
- Synthesizes research into comprehensive legal memos
- Uses proper **Bluebook (21st Edition)** citation format throughout
- Integrates specialist analysis from Legal Analyst and Policy Impact agents

### 6. **Verifier Agent** (`o4-mini`, high reasoning effort)
- Performs quality assurance with focus on legal accuracy and citation quality
- Evaluates memos on 5 criteria with emphasis on Bluebook compliance
- Provides detailed feedback for revision when quality score < 7

### 7. **Revision Agent** (`o4-mini`, high reasoning effort)
- Revises memos based on verifier feedback
- Ensures proper Bluebook citation format and legal accuracy
- Addresses critical and important issues systematically

## üîç Enhanced Search Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Web Search
- **3 agents** now have independent web search capabilities:
  - **Search Agent**: Primary search execution
  - **Legal Analyst**: Targeted legal authority searches
